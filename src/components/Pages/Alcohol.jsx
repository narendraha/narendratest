              <p>Heavy alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for atrial fibrillation(AF). However, the association between habitual changes in heavy habitual drinkers and incident AF remains unclear.</p>
              <p>The treatment of atrial fibrillation(AF) has made significant progress, but the prevention of AF has not received the attention it deserves. A few recent large-sized studies have conducted dose response analysis and reported different conclusions from previous studies on alcohol consumption and AF risk.</p>
              <p>We may encourage you to decrease or stop alcohol consumption, maintain a healthy diet and weight, manage stress and sleep well. To achieve the above goals, we usually recommend to follow up with interdisciplinary team of providers available in your region or your health system</p>
